# GameDatabase
A database created for Blizzard Entertainment Heroes of the Storm 

information is not up to date as the database has not been updated since 2015

To use:

1. Download as zip, extract to location of choice
2. Open folder, find and run "Heroes of the Storm DataBase.jar"
3. There is a README.TXT within the same directory for an extensive list of possible actions/intsructions

I do not claim any involvement with the franchise nor its property, this was just a fun project of recreating a working database made by a friend and me
